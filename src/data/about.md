# A Journey of Growth, Love, and New Beginnings  

In 2015, I embarked on a life-changing journey to the United States to pursue higher education. My first year at Muhlenberg College, with its liberal arts curriculum, helped me discover my passion and aptitude for the sciences, particularly in computer science and mathematics. This realization led me to double major in these fields, achieving excellent academic results. More importantly, during this time, I met my now wife, and our sweet love story began.

Upon graduating, I decided to further my studies in computer science and was accepted into the prestigious University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. During that time, my girlfriend and I had a cat named Gulu. We spent a happy time in the master study period.

However, my time there coincided with the global COVID-19 pandemic, a period that significantly impacted my career path. Due to the uncertainty of the situation, I returned to China to intern at Tencent, eventually joining the company full-time as a software developer after earning my degree.

During my three years at Tencent, I had the privilege of leading and contributing to many impactful projects while actively participating in various company events. Personally, these years were equally fulfilling—I celebrated my marriage after six years of dating and welcomed our daughter Judy into the world.

Yet, as enriching as this period was, I also encountered challenges inherent in the Chinese workplace culture. A visit to New Zealand during a New Year holiday opened my eyes to a lifestyle and environment that resonated deeply with my family's values, inspiring us to envision a life here.

This vision brought me to the University of Auckland, where I am now pursuing a Master of Information Technology. This program not only allows me to expand my understanding of computer science applications across various industries but also provides a valuable opportunity to immerse myself in New Zealand's culture and environment.  

New Zealand also aligns perfectly with my personal passions. Here, I have more time to enjoy activities I love, such as traveling, hiking, fitness, and playing the piano. Its breathtaking landscapes and vibrant culture offer the ideal setting for pursuing these interests, enriching not just my professional life but also my personal well-being. This balance of work and leisure is something I deeply value and look forward to sharing with my family as we build a happy and fulfilling life here.
